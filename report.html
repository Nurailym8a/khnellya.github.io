Our project "Exploring Women's Voices in Cultural Narratives," focuses on the significant cultural events within the ArCo knowledge graph that highlight women's voices, exploring Esther Lurie's Holocaust artworks and Jacqueline Monica Magi's advocacy against gender-based violence, by using advanced technologies for deeper analysis and contribute to enriching the ArCo knowledge graph by creating new knowledge triples.

Objectives: 
</h2>
<p>
1.Explore Diverse Cultural Narratives: 
Identify and explore significant cultural events within the ArCo knowledge graph that center around women's voices, particularly focusing on Esther Lurie's artistic contributions and Jacqueline Monica Magi's advocacy against gender-based violence. 
<p>
2.Utilize Advanced Technologies for Analysis: 
Leverage advanced technologies, such as natural language processing and data mining techniques, to deepen our understanding of the narratives, themes, and historical contexts presented in the cultural events related to "Voci di donne." 
<p> 
3.Enhance the ArCo Knowledge Graph: 
Contribute to the enrichment of the ArCo knowledge graph by creating new knowledge triples that link cultural events, participants (such as Esther Lurie and Jacqueline Monica Magi), and thematic contexts related to women's voices. This includes adding additional metadata and contextual information to enhance accessibility and usability.
